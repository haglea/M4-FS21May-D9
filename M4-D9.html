    <h1>Strive Books</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a new Registration Component on a new route /register and a button in the navbar to get there.</li>
      <li>
        In this Registration Component, create a Controlled Form with:
        <ul>
          <li>Name - Required, at least 2 chars</li>
          <li>Surname - Required, at least 3 chars</li>
          <li>Email - Required - Should be an email field</li>
          <li>Password - Required - Should contain at least 8 chars, 1 digit, 1 letter</li>
          <li>PasswordConfirm - Required - Should be equal than Password</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>All the messages / errors should be displayed properly on the page</li>
      <li>
        The submit button from the form should be "enabled" (=> not disabled) only when the form is validated and when
        each input's constraints are fulfilled. <br />
        When clicked it should display a recap of the information submitted (you can choose between mounting a component
        for it dynamically in the same route or redirecting the user to a new route).
      </li>
